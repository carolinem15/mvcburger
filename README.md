## Description

Eat Da Burger is an application that is organized according to the MVC folder structure and utilizes Handlebars as a template for its HTML. The purpose of this assignment is to practice building a full stack application using an ORM for your SQL database. This assignment was tough to get off the ground at first, but using the in-class CatsApp activity as a guide, I was able to successfully fix some of the errors I was running into. Ultimately, it was a lot of fun building this baby full stack application and I came out of it understanding both Handlebars templates and GET/POST routes much more.

## Installation

Navigate to the link of the deployed application.

## Usage

In the "order burger" field, enter the name of the burger you would like to order. This burger will appear on the left hand side of your browser, in the column titled "BURGERS THAT ARE READY TO BE DEVOURED". Click "devour" to eat your burger, and a list of burgers you have eaten will appear on the right hand side of your app.

## Tests

There are no tests for this application.
